## Experience

### GRIDS-Apps

**Project Reach**
Collaborated with a team of developers, with aid of Kanban and Slack,
to build an enhanced calculator with Universal Windows Platform in Visual Basic.
I provided manual tests and unit-tests for the application using MSTest framework.

**[GRIDSApps.tk](https://gridsapps.tk/)**
Developed a Hugo website with Firebase hosting, to showcase the projects and workshops content of the GRIDS Research Group (University of Aveiro).

**Project Smells-A-Lot**
Built an Android application with Bluetooth connectivity to a microcontroller which emitted scents.
The project's goal was to emit specific comforting scents towards an autistic child to provide a stress relief button.
This tool was used for further investigations at the University of Aveiro Psychology labs.
The team worked in Kanban using Trello.

**GRIDS Stub**
A template for Android applications developed to provide a kickstart for interested students.
Presented in a 5-minute pitch showcasing the advances being done in the GRIDS Research Group.
Mechanical engineering students used the template to build their applications.

### Personal

**[MECSOL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.rlta.mecsol)**
Created an Android application to boost the validation of solid mechanics problems.
The app was deployed to Google Play and is the recommended tool by Aveiro Solid Mechanics' Professors to validate the class problem's results.

**[Cookidump](https://github.com/auino/cookidump)**
Built a new solution for an existing repository that enables offline access to recipes hosted on Bimby/Termomix website.
The solution was based on scraping the website with Selenium's test tools.

**VPN-OMV Multi-server setup**
Deployed and managed 3 Debian servers in different locations with [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) installed.
This provided Network Attached Storage, for personal use, accessible locally and remotely through a Wireguard server with dynamic DNS configured.
Each server performs an off-site backup through Rsync to another server in the group.

**[FSModLoader](https://github.com/Tisila/farming-simulator-mod-loader)**
Developed a mod management program to web scrape a set of given URLs of a game,
in order to both download and keep them updated.
The program was created to ease the otherwise, manual task.
The solution was based in Python with Requests library.

**[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)**
Deployed a Git docker image to host local private repositories. These repositories also accessible remotely through port forwarding with dynamic DNS configuration.
This rendered an in-house useful tool to develop big team projects.

**[MenUA](https://github.com/Tisila/menua)**
Developed a program in Python to deliver the canteens lunch menu to students,
through a Pushbullet channel to which they could subscribe on their smartphones.
The solution requested the menus from UA API and delivered it though Pushbullet API.
The task was scheduled to run at a given time with a Crond command in a Debian server.
Instead waiting for the browser to load the details
in short decision moments, the information is previously served in a style that is easy to read.


## Lectured Workshops

All lectures below were lectured by me individually or together with GRIDS colleagues to groups of several backgrounds and age ranges.

Through this, I learned to manage enrollments through Google Forms with in-house built custom functions,
to send personalized emails in bulk, to provide workshop details.
Along these workshops, attendees access control to content relied in house website Javascript and Firebase (Cloud Storage and Cloud Firestore).


**GRIDS CODE19 Matlab**
This workshop was lectured to all of
Aveiro University campus as part of the [CodeWeek](https://codeweek.eu/) initiative.


**GRIDS 4x4 - This is very APPealing**
In this workshop, mechanical engineering students developed their remote control, to send messages through
an internet of things protocol (MQTT) over
the local network. The server was running an in-house version of Bomberman.
Success of session based on collaborative work.


**GRIDS 4x4 - Going mobile**
The attendees, mechanical engineers developed an app to monitor the light sensor measured intensity.
Deep dived on the internet of things communications and understood how to access Android devices sensors.


**GRIDS 4x4 Does the Python byte?**
With the Google Colab platform, the mechanical engineering students were introduced to Python programming.


**GRIDS Development Beginning of Android Applications**
Taught GRIDS Research group members how to develop an android application with database access.
