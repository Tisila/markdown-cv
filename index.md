## Experience

### GRIDS-Apps

**Project Reach**
Collaborated with a team of developers with aid of Kanban and Slack,
to build an enhanced calculator with Universal Windows Platform in Visual Basic.
I provided manual tests and unit-tests for the application using MSTest framework.

**[GRIDSApps.tk](https://gridsapps.tk/)**
Developed a Hugo website with Firebase hosting to showcase the projects and workshops content of the GRIDS Research Group, of University of Aveiro.

**Project Smells-A-Lot**
Built an Android application with Bluetooth connectivity to a 3D printed box with microcontroller which emitted scents.
The goal was to emit specific comforting scents towards an autistic child to provide a stress relief button.
This tool was used further investigations at the University of Aveiro Psychology labs.
The team was managed through Kanban system Trello.

**GRIDS Stub**
A template for Android applications developed to provide a kickstart for interested students.
Presented at SRGx, a 5 minute pitch showcasing the advances being done in the GRIDS Research Group.
Many mechanical engineering department students used the template to build their own applications.

### Personal

**[MECSOL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.rlta.mecsol)**
Created an Android application to boost the confirmation of solid mechanics problem solutions as well as it's reliability.
The app was deployed to Google Play and is the recommended tool by teachers of solid mechanics to validate class problem's results.

**[Cookidump](https://github.com/auino/cookidump)**
Built a new solution for an existing repository which enables offline access to recipes hosted on Bimby/Termomix website.
The solution was based on scraping the website with Selenium's test tools.

**VPN-OMV Multi server setup**
Deployed and managed 3 Debian servers in different locations with [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) installed.
This provided Network Attached Storage for personal use locally and remotely through a Wireguard server with dynamic DNS configured.
Each server performs an off-site backup through Rsync to another server in the group.

**[FSModLoader](https://github.com/Tisila/farming-simulator-mod-loader)**
Developed a mod management program 
in Python with Requests library to web scrape a set of given URLs to the mod webpage
of a game to download the mods as well as keeping them updated.

**[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)** Hosted a Git docker image to host local private repositories also accessible remotely through port forwarding with dynamic DNS configuration.
This rendered a useful combination to develop bigger team projects without paid feature restrictions from bigger git providers.

**ArdTable**
Designed and created a 3D printed, two axis vice in a university signature.
The vice had incremental encoder readings shown through a microcontroller with LCD display.

**[MenUA](https://github.com/Tisila/menua)**
Developed program in Python to deliver the canteens lunch menu, requested from UA API and delivered trough PushBullet API to the users smartphones.
The task was scheduled to run at a given time prior to lunch with a Crond command in a Debian server.
This tool provided lunch menu descriptions to students through a [Pushbullet channel](https://www.pushbullet.com/channel?tag=rlta) to which they could subscribe.


## Lectured Workshops

All lectures below were lectured by me individually or together with GRIDS colleagues to groups of several backgrounds and age ranges.
Learned to manage enrollments through Google Forms with in-house built custom functions,
to send personalized emails in bulk, in order to provide workshop details.
Along the workshops, control over the content access to attendees relied on website Javascript and Firebase (Cloud Storage and Cloud Firestore).


**GRIDS CODE19 Matlab**
The challenge was to solve a travelling salesman problem in which the algorithm
had to find the shortest distance to travel. This workshop was lectured to all of
Aveiro University campus as part of the [CodeWeek](https://codeweek.eu/) initiative.


**GRIDS 4x4 - This is very APPealing**
In this workshop, mechanical engineering students had to develop their own remote control, in order to send messages through
an internet of things protocol called MQTT over
the local network, where a server subscribed to all the users channels and
moved their players accordingly. The server was running an in-house version of Bomberman.
Realized that a team built on trust can provide great results. 
<!-- is this ok? -->


**GRIDS 4x4 - Going mobile**
The attendees developed an app to monitor the light sensor measured intensity.
This value was then sent to through MQTT to a broker where a client subscribed to all
user channels and displayed a 3D map of the values in the room.
The attendees were mechanical engineering students.
Deep dived on the internet of things communications and understood how to access Android devices sensors.


**GRIDS 4x4 Does the Python byte?**
With the Google Colab platform, the mechanical engineering students were taught how to compute 
the pi value using 3 different algorithms using Python.
I understood that creating your solution provides greater insight about the problem.


**GRIDS Development Beginning of Android Applications**
Taught GRIDS Research group teachers and researchers how to develop a contacts android application with database access.
Each attendee created their own database (Google FusionTables) and built the app that was a viewer/manager of the stored online data. 
I learned how to access and query a database.
