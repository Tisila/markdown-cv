## Experience

### GRIDS-Apps

**Project Reach**
Managed a team of developers with aid of Kan-Ban and Slack,
to build an enhanced calculator with Universal Windows Platform in Visual Basic.
The application was tested manually and with unit-tests.

[GRIDSApps.tk](https://gridsapps.tk/) 
Developed a Hugo website with Firebase hosting to showcase the projects and workshops content of the team.

**Project Smells-A-Lot**
Built an Android application with Bluetooth connectivity to a microcontroller which emitted scents.
The team was managed through Kan-Ban system Trello.

**GRIDS Stub**
A template Android application was developed to provide a kickstart for interested students.
The app provided two main functionalities, a formula calculator and an interpolator.

### Personal

[MECSOL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.rlta.mecsol)
Created an Android application to boost the confirmation of solid mechanics problem solutions as well as it's reliability.
The app was deployed to Google Play and was the recomended tool by teachers to validate the problem results.

[Cookidump](https://github.com/auino/cookidump)
Built a new solution for an existing repository which enables offline access to recipes hosted on Bimby/Termomix website.
The solution was based on scraping the website with Selenium's chromedriver.

VPN-OMV Multi server setup
Deployed and managed 3 Debian servers in different locations with OpenMediaVault installed.
This provided Network Atached Storage locally and also through a Wireguard server.
Each server performs an off-site backup through Rsync to another server in the group.

Developed a mod management program ([FSModLoader](https://github.com/Tisila/farming-simulator-mod-loader))
in **Python** with **Requests** library to web scrape the given mod links
of a game to download the mods as well as keeping them updated.

Hosted a **Git** (Gitea) docker image to host local private repositories accessible online through port forwarding.

ArdTable
Designed and created a 3D printed, two axis vice in a school project.
The vice had incremental encoder readings shown in a microcontroller with LCD display.

Developed program in **Python** to deliver the canteens lunch menu, requested from UA API and delivered trough PushBullet API to the users smartphone.
The task was scheduled to run at a given time prior to lunch with a **Crond** command in a Debian server.



## Lectured Workshops

### GRIDS CODE19 Matlab

The challenge was to solve a travelling salesman problem in which the algorithm
had to find the shortest distance to travel. This workshop was part of the CodeWeek initiative.


### GRIDS 4x4 - This is very APPealing

In this workshop the students had to develop their own remote, to send MQTT messages over
the local network where a server subscribed to all the users channels and
moved their players accordingly. The server was running an in-house version of Bomberman.


### GRIDS 4x4 - Going mobile

The users developed an app to monitor the light sensor measured intensity.
This value was then sent to through MQTT to a broker where a client subscribed to all
user channels and displayed a 3D map of the values in the room.


### GRIDS 4x4 Does the Python byte?

With the Google Colab platform, the students were told how to compute 
the pi value using 3 different algorithms.



## Education
